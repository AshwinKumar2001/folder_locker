Certain things to note about this application:

1) This version only allows a user to hide folders( which are not empty ).
2) When you hide a folder with whitespace in between for example --> "New Folder", it will appear as "New_Folder" in the listbox. It is the same thing.
   This is also temporary. Newer versions will improve upon this.

PLEASE TRY TO HIDE SMALL SIZED FOLDERS ( < 50 KB) INITIALLY. THIS IS BECAUSE, LARGER FOLDERS WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO ENCRYPT AND HENCE, IT MAY LOOK LIKE THE APPLICATION HAS FROZEN.
